Some useful (free) resources and cool blog posts about ML. Using this post to keep track of them:
- cool blog post about [distributed training in pytorch](https://yangkky.github.io/2019/07/08/distributed-pytorch-tutorial.html)
- another great blog post on [triplet loss and online triplet mining](https://omoindrot.github.io/triplet-loss)
- recently, I have been getting into RL and started with the [Sutton-Barto book](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf)
