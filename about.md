## About

I work as a Deep Learning Engineer but I am an overall AI enthusiast. I am also starting to enjoy more and more building infrastructures. I currently work
at AI Reverie. It's my third time joining a start up at the seed round and I love it! Previously, I was studying Earth and Environmental sciences in France and California. I started my PhD at Stanford in 2015 but took a leave after two years to get some experience in the industry. After two years working for start-ups,
I dropped out of the PhD program. 


### Some emigration details
