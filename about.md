I am a Deep Learning Engineer at Aquabyte, an Computer Vision and Deep Learning start up based in San Francisco, CA. I started a PhD at Stanford University in the School of Earth, Energy and Environmental Sciences in 2015. I am on a leave of absence from my program until 2019. This leave is helping me explore career options outside of academia. I am currently on a J-1 Academic Training permit that will allow me to work until December 2018 without my employer having to sponsor my visa.
