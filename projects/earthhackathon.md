## Stanford Earh Hackathon 2018

Spring 2018, I joined with two friends ([Amir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amirdel/) and 
[Noah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-athens/)) the [Stanford Big Earth Hackathon](https://bigearthhacks.stanford.edu/april2018)
where we reached third place with a deep learning model for building damage assessment. 

The code is available here: [Stanford hack](https://github.com/amirdel/stanfordHacks).
