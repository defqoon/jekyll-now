## Eddy tracking - Spring 2014

Over the spring 2014, I worked at Caltech under the supervision of [Andrew Thompson](http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~andrewt/).
Within his physical oceanography group, I worked with satellite images of sea surface height (SSH) as well
as with [glider](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ocean-gliders.html) data. We were interesting
in understanding the physical properties of the [ocean mixed layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_layer).
To do so, we wanted to track [oceanic eddies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_(fluid_dynamics)) 
and find occurrences when the glider was crossing the path of an eddy. Doing so, we would be able to
understand how an eddy mixes the properties (temperature, salinity) of the oceanic upper layer.

I coded an algorithm to detect and track the eddies over time based on the following paper:
[Global observations of nonlinear mesoscale eddies
](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661111000036). 

The code will be made available here:
