## Paleosismology - Fall 2013

I worked and lived for more than 6 months in Nepal between Fall 2013 and Spring 2014. My project
was in collaboration with the [French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission](http://www.cea.fr/english) and
the Nepali Seismologic Center.

This project lead to a publication in Earth and Planetary Science Letters: [Surface ruptures of large Himalayan 
earthquakes in Western Nepal: Evidence along a reactivated strand of the Main Boundary 
Thrust](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X15007463).
