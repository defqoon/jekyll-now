## Campervan building - Ongoing

Over the summer 2018, I bought a 1989 GMC Vandura from a fellow french man.

The car was in pretty good shape (around 100k miles) and just had to get some minor repairs done. When I bought, it was a 7 seater, with the 3 seats in the back stuck in horizontal position, creating a really uncomfortable bed. Since I wanted to create a camper, my first step was to get rid of the seats to put a bed. By the way, if you ever need inspiration to build a campervan, there are about 5 million website to do so. I got a lot of inspiration from this one: https://faroutride.com/.

Taking off the seats was realtively straightforward. All the screws holes were filled up. Before building the bed, I decided to improve the flooring by adding a layer of insulation. We added a layer of polystyrene and a layer of plywood on top of the car floor. We finally used vinyl to give it a better look.

Next step was to build the bed. We used 6 4x4 and a thicker layer of plywood for the structure.
